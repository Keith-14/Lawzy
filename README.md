# Lawzy
This project is an AI-driven legal assistance platform designed to help citizens understand and act on common legal issues without immediately requiring professional legal counsel. It focuses on reducing the initial friction people face when dealing with legal problems by providing structured guidance, relevant legal references, and ready-to-use documents.

Users can submit legal queries in their native language. The system standardizes the input into English and uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to identify and rank the most relevant sections from Indian legal frameworks such as the IPC and Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). Instead of a conversational chat response, the platform delivers structured, card-based outputs that clearly break down the issue, practical remedies, procedural steps, required dependencies, and statutory citations.

The platform also supports instant document generation, automatically creating essential legal drafts (e.g., complaint letters, formal notices) as printable PDFs based on the user’s case context. To further prepare users for real-world legal interactions, it includes a cross-questioning simulation feature that generates probable questions authorities may ask, helping users organize evidence and responses in advance.

Overall, the system bridges the gap between legal uncertainty and actionable next steps by combining multilingual NLP, legal document retrieval, and an intuitive UI—empowering users to move forward with clarity and confidence.
